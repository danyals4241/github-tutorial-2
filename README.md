## Git vs. GitHub
* **_Git_**:  
Git is a software that runs in the command line. Git takes a snapshot of code that you write so you can look back at it. Git also allows you to send things up to your remote repository (the cloud) and to pull it back down. 
* **_Github_**:  
GitHub is a web-based git respotory hosting service, you may often hear this being referd to as the cloud. Github is different to git beause you will always need git for github but you may not always need github for git. Github is an amayzing tool because it provides a easy way to colaborate your code with someone else. Because it is on the internet anyone can see it and pull it down to their local repository so that they can make changes to it that you have the ability to accept or deny.
